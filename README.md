# NekCEM CEEDling

NekCEM CEEDling is a lightweight subset of NekCEM, relavant to solving electromagnetic systems. It allows software and hardware developers to understand the basic structure and computational costs of NekCEM over a broad spectrum of architectures ranging from software-based simulators running at one ten-thousandth the speed of current processors to exascale platforms running millions of times faster than single-core platforms. NekCEM provides flexibility to adapt new programming approaches for scalability and performance studies on a variety of platforms without having to understand all the features of NekCEM, currently supporting CPU/GPU runs.
